      <p>My name is Daniel VonMoser and I have just completed my first week at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. Before enrolling
        at Northwestern, I taught Special Education and spent time in the Air Force. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from
        Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL. I currently reside on the Northwest Side of Chicago with my wife and
        one year old son. When I am not at school or working, I spend my time running, binge watching television shows, and
        hanging out with my awesome family. Having spent time in different career fields, I very slowly became aware that
        what I wanted to do with my life was nowhere close to what I actually went to school for. I basically spent a ton
        of money on an education that had me yelling at children for more than half of the day. As you may probably guess,
        it gets old very quickly. So, in order to do something I really loved and had a passion for, I decided to quit my
        job and spend even more money on another education. However, I know this time it will have a different outcome and
        actually pay off.</p>
